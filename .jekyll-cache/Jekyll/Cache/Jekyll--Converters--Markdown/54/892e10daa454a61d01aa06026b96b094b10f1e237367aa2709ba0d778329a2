<p>Hi, my name is Matt, I’m an experienced engineer with a proven track record deploying technical systems and driving business value.
<br />
<br />
I enjoy helping businesses drive value from their people, systems and processes using data and modern cloud systems. Analytics Engineering is the closest approximation.
<br />
<br />
I have significant expertise in SME businesses - funding, data, accounting, CRM, ERP, tech, strategy, growth.
<br />
<br />
<!-- I'm available for consulting and remote or in person development. -->

<br />
I’m currently based in London, UK.
