<em>2021 - Pyzel phantom 6â€™0 32L</em></p>

<p>This board has been really good so far, paddles better than I expected and feels great in better waves. Doesnâ€™t hold a rail in very big waves as I discovered at Killers in December 2020.</p>

<em>2021 - Lost BEAN BAG 5â€™8  22.50  2.75  41L</em></p>

<p>Great in <em>VERY</em> small waves, has a massively wide tail so really struggles in anything bigger than waist high, and especially bad in hollow waves. Very fun for waves that would otherwise be great on a longboard, and paddles incredibly well for the size. Have bought quad rear fins to try out, as this doesnâ€™t feel great as a thruster.</p>

<em>2020 - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B31uGI-HlaI/">SkinDog</a> 6â€™0 x 21 x 2 1/2 35L</em></p>

<p>This board was super fun at The Wave artificial wave. It is one of the rental boards, and thankfully available. It definitely helped to have the extra volume as the fresh water isnâ€™t very bouyant and is freezing cold, so extra neoprene means you need the volume.
The 2+1 fin configuration is great for loosening the board up, as you donâ€™t need the hold in the very weak waves (they hadnâ€™t enabled Advanced+ so the wave was tiny).</p>

<p>Would really like to get one of these for weaker surf days.</p>

<em>2020 - <a href="https://www.pyzelsurfboards.com/index.php?page=surfboard-details&amp;id=535">Pyzel JJF Slab 2.0</a> 6â€™2	20 1/4	2 5/8	34.70L</em></p>

<p>This board went well in medium quality Cape Town surf. Havenâ€™t really surfed it in great surf, but feels maybe too high performance for Cape Town surf (which is generally average IMO).</p>

<em>2020 - The Wave rental board - 6â€™6 37L boat</em></p>

<p>Terrible, huge board. Was running late to the session and had to grab whatever was left over.</p>

<em>2020 - Greg Smith retro 6â€™1 x 19 x 2.8?</em></p>

<p>Funky retro replica of the original <a href="https://surfsimply.com/surfboards/the-history-of-surfboard-design-simon-anderson-and-the-thruster/">Simon Anderson Thruster</a>. Really quite hard to surf, very sensitive to back foot weighting, doesnâ€™t really generate speed and hard to turn.</p>

<p>Super fun rental board for morocco trip, goes really well down the line in the Morocco point breaks</p>

<p>Torq fish skimming off the top. Not such an easy board to wrap turns, prefers just trimming and gliding.</p>

<em>2016 - Fishstix 6.3 19.5 2.75 34 L</em></p>

<p>Fun board for the smaller days at Seal Point. My first board with LOTS of volume. Great decision, never looked back.</p>

<em>2015 - Clayton Jester 5â€™10 x 19 x 2 3/8  27.9 litres</em></p>

<p>This was too small. Fun at huge days at Llandudno, but otherwise too little volume. Really struggled.</p>

<em>2014 - Dutchie 6â€™2 18.1/2 2./1/2 rounded pin</em></p>

<p>Very mediocre 2nd hand board, not sure where it came from but really didnâ€™t make me amped to surf at all.</p>

<p>Board I bought to take to Bali. Quite a lot of volume, canâ€™t quite remember that much about it, but seemed maybe not enough rocker for the waves in Bali. Quite enjoyed it, sad to leave it there.</p>

<em>2013 - Spowy 6â€™1x18x2?</em></p>

<p>Board I bought to take to Bali. Nice standard board that went really well in good conditions. Got a cracker barrel, snapped it the next day.</p>

<em>2013 - Baron rounded step up 	6.3 x 18 x 2?</em></p>

<p>Board I bought to take to Bali. Mediocre board. Didnâ€™t need a step up in Bali, when the waves got bigger overhead it got too heavy anyway :)</p>

<p>Really liked this board, snapped the nose at Llandudno and was pretty sad.</p>

<em>2005 - Rebel boggy stuk-kak</em></p>

<p>This was a terrible board. Didnâ€™t turn, didnâ€™t duck-dive, finnicky and hard to surf.</p>

<em>1997 - Titch Paul Twinnie</em></p>

<p>Epic 80â€™s twin fin, sad to have given this board away. Surfed it a few times in the late 2000â€™s and was super interesting. Very hard to surf bigger waves.</p>
