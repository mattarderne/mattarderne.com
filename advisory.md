_Helping companies scale by providing data expertise._

I have a passion for data, and deep insight into emerging technology. With these, I have enabled businesses to grow by unlocking the value in their data, and aligning their tech strategy with the opportunities available to a data driven company.
<br>
<br>
Let's work together to unlock the hidden value in your business, either through helping <br><b>define your strategy</b>, or <b>implement technology </b>to help you execute against and exceed your targets. 
<br>
I have significant expertise in SME businesses - funding, data, accounting, CRM, ERP, tech, strategy, growth.
<br>
I'm available for consulting and remote or in person development.
