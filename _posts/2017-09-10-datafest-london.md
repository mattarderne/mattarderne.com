![Roping up][c1]

I attended Denodo Datafest in London, this was an exceptionally good opportunity to understand the product roadmap and how other clients are using and gaining value from the product. I also attended the Customer Advisory Panel to try and assist with the roadmap development of the product. See Livestream here: https://www.denodo.com/en/page/denodo-datafest-2017-sessions
