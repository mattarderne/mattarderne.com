I like to treat this page as a bit of a personal garden. I've got a few links below, mostly related to things I'm currently interested in or have been interested in. I don't really do social media anymore, and much prefer the unwalled garden of a website that is entirely mine to do with whatever I feel like.

> I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so

Feel free to take a look around!

# About me

I enjoy learning new things. This includes technology, physical skills and learning new sports. A few of the outdoor activities I enjoy include downhill skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, mountain-biking, rock-climbing & sailing. I also enjoy photography and videography, as a hobby.

I love reading and try to read a few books every month, usually a mix of fiction and non-fiction.

# My personal pages:

* [Writing](/writing/writing/) - I'm working on my ability to communicate through writing. This is the workshop. 
* [Sailing](/about/sailing/) - Some sailing pics and a logbook

* [Media](/about/media/) - Videos of me doing things
