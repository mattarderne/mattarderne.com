I like to treat this page as a bit of a personal garden. I've got a few links below, mostly related to things I'm currently interested in or have been interested in. Feel free to take a look around.

> I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so

### My personal pages:

* [Writing](/writing/writing/) - Some writing related to work, and some more general thoughts
* [Sailing](/about/sailing/) - Some sailing pics and a logbook
* [Surfing](/about/surfing/) - Every surfboard I've ever owned
* [Media](/about/sports/) - Videos of me doing things
* [Photography](https://film.rdrn.dev/film) - Dragging around a film camera for fun and personal development...
* [Recipe Book](https://food.rdrn.dev/) - Some great stuff in there, ask me about my bread!
