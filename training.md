> I am passionate about teaching, and offer educational services to better enable data teams.

I teach working professionals the basics of **Excel, SQL** and **Data Vizualization** as an instructor on the [General Assembly Data Analytics](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-analytics) course.

Beyond that, I can get your team of data analysts, product managers and developers up to speed on the Modern Data Analytics Stack.

Drop me an email to tailor a workshop and for details on availability and pricing.
