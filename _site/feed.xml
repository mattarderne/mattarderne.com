I also used it as an excuse to play with &lt;a href=&quot;http://seaborn.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;seaborn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please have a look at the full &lt;a href=&quot;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28622/120678-BRI-PUBLIC-24-10-2017-14-33-7-LWLJFinOKR.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y&quot;&gt;article here&lt;/a&gt;. What follows is a (very) brief summary and two of the plots I made with seaborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bottom-line&quot;&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through new technologies and business models, off-grid power markets promise to bring electricity access to more rural communities at a faster pace than is possible with grid extension alone. Apart from regulatory support and access to international finance, this incipient market sector depends critically on accurate and timely data. New approaches to data are gaining momentum in developing countries and have the potential to transform the rural electrification agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-are-we-talking-about-off-grid-electricity&quot;&gt;Why are we talking about off-grid electricity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a billion people lack access to electricity, and many of them live far from the grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/open1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Access-HDI&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-does-off-grid-technology-fit-in&quot;&gt;Where does off-grid technology fit in?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When villages or towns are very far from existing infrastructure, or are very small, it can be much more cost-effective to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://energypedia.info/wiki/Mini_Grids&quot;&gt;mini-grid&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://energypedia.info/wiki/Solar_Home_Systems_(SHS)&quot;&gt;stand-alone&lt;/a&gt; systems to provide electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/open2.png&quot; alt=&quot;SHS-MG-Grid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-obstacles-to-market-analysis-in-this-field&quot;&gt;What are the obstacles to market analysis in this field?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of technical data, along with outdated institutional systems, can hinder progress. These new technologies and approaches are creating possibilities that did not exist before, but they are capital intensive and have a long payback time in a sector where capital is still relatively limited. Careful market analysis is therefore required to target communities that are in need, can pay,have potential for growth, and are unlikely to be connected to the grid before the off-grid project can pay off. The information required for this analysis is often hard to come by or non-existent in developing countries, which prevents both the private and public sectors from being able to plan strategically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-key-lessons-and-recommendations-emerge-from-efforts-to-date&quot;&gt;Five key lessons and recommendations emerge from efforts to date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The market for off-grid development is there and can be an important driver of increased access in areas that are far from the grid. Even when countries have ambitious goals of connecting the entire country, off-grid solutions can be a stopgap to quicken the pace of electrification, while also increasing generating capacity – a particularly valuable factor in situations where system capacity is insufficient to supply newly extended grid lines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2:&lt;/strong&gt; GIS is already being used around the world to target areas that are both in need (far from the grid and not likely to be connected soon) and offering a promising market (densely populated and already spending on other fuels, while also offering the potential for development of non-household uses of electricity). GIS capabilities have allowed the sector to expand and attract international finance and interest, but governments and development partners must support these approaches to bring transformational change that will add benefit throughout the sector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Many developing countries still suffer from a lack of accessible and transparent data, which discourages private sector investments at a larger scale. The problem lies not only in the actual lack of data, but   also in making what data there are available for use. Attitudes are slowly changing, with many countries embracing the benefits created by open-data policies – a promising trend that should be encouraged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the technical advances achieved to date require highly specialized capacity and resources, which has kept many players from achieving higher efficiency. With open data and focused efforts in certain areas where data can be transformational as a public good, it is possible to   create a more level playing field and reduce the barriers to entering the market. Modern analytics are showing promise by transforming data into   insights and information that can be used to make decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5:&lt;/strong&gt; All the discoveries from the activities reported here have shown that support from the public sector is needed to foster interdepartmental and multi-stakeholder cooperation. Without alignment of goals between public and private institutions, private developers will constantly be on the defensive. They depend on government data for planning, and on government regulation and policy for continued profitability. Government planners should recognize that private developers offer a powerful force for improving access to electricity and the development benefits it brings.&lt;/li&gt;

Often, this was while modelling the ‘nexus’ between different systems, such as energy, water and climate – as opposed to treating these as separate fields of study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this was done in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weap21.org/index.asp?NewLang=EN&quot;&gt;WEAP&lt;/a&gt;, a hydrological modelling package courtesy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sei.org/&quot;&gt;Stockholm Environmental Institute&lt;/a&gt;.  This provided an easy user interface, and access to a variety of complex models and systems for things such as rainwater run-off and crop requirements. However, it isn’t easily scriptable, and is mostly suited to very localised systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when my colleagues and I wanted to conduct a continent-scale assessment of mini-hydropower potential, we had to turn elsewhere. For the first version of this, I created a simple script to run down every river in a given network and calculate the elevation drop (head) between points to estimate hydropower potential. We applied this to the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa, using river networks from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hydrosheds.org/&quot;&gt;HydroSHEDS&lt;/a&gt; and run-off data from the EU’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/water&quot;&gt;Joint Research Centre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: The paper we wrote on this has recently been published with the journal Energies: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/11/11/3100&quot;&gt;A Geospatial Assessment of Small-Scale Hydropower Potential in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I decided to improve and generalise this simple model and came with an unwieldy bit of code called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carderne/hydro-networks&quot;&gt;hydro-networks&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of just creating points all over the show, I set out to create a model that would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conduct massive scale hydrological modelling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calculate run-off and stream-flow using precipitation and land-use data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Model rivers in a network-aware manner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow point sources/drains such as farms and dams to be added procedurally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a rough estimate, I achieved about 3/4 of this, and realised run-off modelling is damn hard. What I did manage was still pretty fun, so I’m going to go over an example below, in the hopes that one day I’ll pick this up again and complete it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-direction-aware-river-networks&quot;&gt;Create direction-aware river networks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model uses the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://geopandas.org/&quot;&gt;GeoPandas&lt;/a&gt; library to read in the river network data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hydrosheds.org/&quot;&gt;HydroSHEDS&lt;/a&gt;. It is very happy crunching the data for the whole African continent, but to make this easier, I’ve clipped out a small river called Dieprivier  just outside Cape Town(yes, they exist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/hydro1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dieprivier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we zoom into a small section, we see the the model-generated layer (purple)matches pretty well with the painstakingly traced data (light blue) fromOpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/hydro2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Section&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model then goes through a couple of steps to convert this GIS data into something we can use for modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go through every river segment in the input data, and create for it a separate arc, which altogether form the network data structure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As it does this, create another data structure called nodes that contains all of these points where arcs meet or terminate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then tell every arc  which two nodes it is connected to, and tell each node which arcs it is connected to. This means if we know a node location, we know which arcs connect to it, and therefore which other nodes are connected, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small section of the resulting layers is shown below, with the nodes at the intersections of river arcs. The large green node knows which arcs are connected to it (also in green) and they in turn know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/hydro3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nodes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;giving-the-network-some-order&quot;&gt;Giving the network some order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all very well, but it’s still just a bunch of lines and dots. To make this network a lot easier to use, we must assign &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_order&quot;&gt;stream order&lt;/a&gt; to the arcs – essentially indicating how many upstream branches they have. This is a useful proxy for how ‘big’ any part of a river is relative to the network, but also allows the model to easily orientate itself to what is up- and down-stream of any node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main approaches to this, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strahler_number&quot;&gt;Strahler number&lt;/a&gt; and the Shreve number. For the Strahler number, the smallest tributaries are assigned an order of 1. These are then followed down, and when two 1’s join, they form a 2. If two streams with a different number join, it gets the higher of the two, i.e. 1+2=2. The Shreve number is similar, except the numbers always add, so 1+2=3! For this model, I used the Shreve number, as it ensures that a downstream section always has a higher number that the sections upstream of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, I adapted the algorithm from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb01057.x&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; (Gleyzer, et al., 2007), a beautiful but not very intuitive recursive function. Basically, it starts at the mouth of a given river (identified by a separate bit of code) and then follows recursively up the network until it reaches the mountain-top tributaries. Then it trickles back down to the mouth, adding up the stream orders as it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;def shreve(arc_index, direction_node_id, network, nodes):
    up_stream_orders = []
    if len(nodes[direction_node_id]) == 5:
        network[arc_index][7] = 1
    else:
        for index, arc in enumerate(nodes[direction_node_id]):
            if index &amp;gt;= 4:
                if network[arc][0] != arc_index:
                    if network[arc][5] != direction_node_id:
                        up_stream_orders.append(shreve(arc,
                            network[arc][5], network, nodes))
                    else:
                        up_stream_orders.append(shreve(arc,
                            network[arc][6], network, nodes))
        max_orders = heapq.nlargest(2, up_stream_orders)
        if len(max_orders) == 2:
            order = 0 + max_orders[0] + max_orders[1]
        else:
            order = 0 + max(up_stream_orders)

        network[arc_index][7] = order
    return network[arc_index][7]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to the entire river network, it looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/hydro4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stream order&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-data-layers-and-doing-things&quot;&gt;Adding data layers and doing things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the network set up and ordered, it’s time to do something with it! In addition to the run-off data mentioned further up, there are a few other important layers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital elevation model (DEM), normally from NASA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/&quot;&gt;SRTM &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flow accumulation, which is derived from the DEM and also available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hydrosheds.org/&quot;&gt;HydroSHEDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Land cover, used for modelling run-off and available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/land-water/land/land-governance/land-resources-planning-toolbox/category/details/en/c/1036355/&quot;&gt;from the FAO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ETo, the reference evapo-transpiration for an area, also available from the FAO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Precipitation, from many sources, hopefully monthly, never easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here’s our same river overlaid with the DEM elevation data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/hydro5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DEM&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I used the laborious and buggy &lt;a href=&quot;http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm&quot;&gt;ArcPy&lt;/a&gt;  t oextract all of this information in the network and nodes data structures, but now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio&quot;&gt;rasterio&lt;/a&gt; makes this a walk in the park. It’s a straightforward library for reading raster GIS data and sampling and manipulating it, and takes only a few lines to load all of this new data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calculating-hydropower-potential&quot;&gt;Calculating hydropower potential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that we can do with all of this data is replicate the hydropower estimates, from the paper we wrote, except now just for Dieprivier in Cape Town.Note that this is exclusively for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-of-the-river_hydroelectricity&quot;&gt;run-of-river&lt;/a&gt; mini-hydropower. To estimate power output, we use the hydropower formula as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;P = ηρgQH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where P  is the power output, η  is the efficiency, ρ  is the density of water,and g is acceleration due to gravity. Q is the flow-rate, and H is the head, or height difference available. These last two must be calculated for each point using the data described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head is simple: we get the height for our chosen point, and then look a set distance up-stream and get the height there – the difference between these is the head. The flow-rate is more complicated. The global run-off data we have is provided in m/s, where we need m3/s. So we do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Q = runoff × catchment-area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where catchment-area is the total area upstream of the selected point.Multiplying these together calculates the theoretical amount of water that should flow past this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying this to Dieprivier, the model creates a point every 500 metres and calculates the head over the preceding 500 metres. By filtering to only include those with at least 10 metres of head and more than 100 kW output, we get the following suggested point of 162 kW, with 12 metres of head and flow rate of 2.75 m3/s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/hydro6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hydropower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is an unchecked, un-calibrated example result, I’m not at all suggesting someone should build a mini-hydropower site there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-further-with-rainfall-run-off-and-discharge&quot;&gt;Going further with rainfall run-off and discharge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result above was calculated using the GSCD, which provides only a single value, with no monthly or yearly variations. This doesn’t provide much information about seasonal changes, nor allow for any calibrations with stream gauges, which will likely be on a daily or monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve this, I extended the model to work with precipitation as an input instead, which is often available as monthly (or even daily data). For each node then, the model takes local precipitation, land cover and evapo-transpiration data and uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weap21.org/webhelp/hydrology.htm&quot;&gt;Simplified Coefficeint Method&lt;/a&gt; to calculate local rainfall run-off. This is then carried downstream in the model, and when stream join,their flows are combined. At the same time, there are certain losses on each stream due to various causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then every river section has a (potentially) more accurate discharge associated with it, which is now able to vary by month and day. So in the example above, we could specify not only the mean power output, but also show which months we expect to have lower and higher output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for this is all with the model in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carderne/hydro-networks&quot;&gt;GitHub rep&lt;/a&gt;, but be aware – it takes a lot of fiddling and calibration to get useful numbers out, and precipitation and stream-gauge data often require a lot more data wrangling to make ready for the model.I was on the verge of setting up the model to calibrate against some measurements automatically, but that’ll have to be a project for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;towards-a-generalised-model&quot;&gt;Towards a generalised model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, it’s not a huge step to add other point withdrawals (such as city water requirements or a farm) and use the model to make predictions about the system. For example, by including projected precipitation changes and increased population (and hence increased withdrawals) we could model whether there would be a water shortfall, and in which months this would be most severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, the model isn’t quite there, but hopefully I’ll come back to it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Arderne</name></author><category term="inside" /><summary type="html">Ironically, a large part of my work at KTH's Division of Energy Systems Analysis was modelling complex hydrological systems.

Left to right: Michael Kloos, Chris Arderne, Rick Kotze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew this already, but our three weeks in Mexico drove the message home on an almost daily basis. This is the story of three South African amigos fumbling their way up a few volcanoes and some jagged rock faces in the land of chillies, tortillas, piñatas and moustaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/mex2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Moustaches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was simple enough: keep the plan modest, and figure the details out when we get there… How difficult could two volcanoes and some rocks be? Three objectives, and three weeks to accomplish them. The plan (if it could be called that) was for Rick and Michael to head straight to the primary objective and highest peak in Mexico, Pico de Orizaba. They would start figuring things out while waiting to hear whether Chris (whose passport was precariously full) would be able to enter Mexico at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it, it’s classic hubris. With Andean experience above 6 000 m, Chris felt confident the altitude would be no obstacle. Having been in the high5 000s in the Cordillera Blanca, Michael thought he knew what he was in for.Only Rick, having suffered up Elbrus, was properly prepared to suffer again. We semi-confidently set Christmas day for our summit attempt, just four days from sea level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one by one we succumbed. A strenuous hike at 3 000 m laid Rick low. Our first acclimatisation hike to 4 800 m got Chris. And the next day Michael was brought down at the same height. It was a sobering blow for the Supertramps.Other people were passing through base camp and reaching the summit - most of them looking haggard and miserable on the way down. We decided that wasn’t the summit story we wanted. We wanted to get to the summit on our terms: quickly,confidently, and with the energy to enjoy it and be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/mex3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Home&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/mex4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orizaba&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on Christmas day, we made a tough decision: we bailed. After a rest back in town, we ate some beans and said hasta luego to Orizaba, and took the first of the buses that would bring us to Iztaccíhuatl, Mexico’s third highest peak.(Popocatépetl, the second, is currently un-climbable due to volcanic activity.) We’d been told Izta was more or less a walk up, so we stashed our technical gear in the small town of Santiago and caught a minibus taxi to the dusty base camp.In between mouthfuls of the trip’s worst tacos, we saw hikers trudging off the mountain - fully geared up with crampons and helmets…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we were, getting ready for a short sleep and an early start up an easy mountain. And once again our over-confidence and poor planning stymied us.Morale hit an all-time low, and we regrouped in the dust-covered tent to gather our thoughts. The prospect of no Mexican summits seemed all too possible, and all too much to handle. Eventually we were able to dry our eyes and make a plan.Michael would hitch-hike to Amecameca to rent some crampons, Chris would hitch toSantiago to fetch the other gear, and Rick would look after the dusty-getting-dustier tent. Finally, we could have our pre-summit dinner and go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got up a few hours before sunrise, ready to hike the 1 300 vertical metres and seven horizontal km to the summit. And immediately got lost in the dark. Our delicate morales could hardly bear it, but after stumbling around precarious cliffs for two hours, we retraced our steps and found the very well-trodden path in the first rays of dawn. Two hours behind schedule, the day was a race against the bad afternoon weather. And to climb Iztaccíhuatl (“the white woman” in Nahuatl), you have to climb her feet and knees, cross her thighs and stomach and finally finish on one of her two… summits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/mex5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Popo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/mex6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Christmas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time we summited something, we saw how far there still was to go, and we debated whether we still had the time to make it safely there and back. Rick did his best to keep spirits high, and after about eight hours we made it to the very easy glacier crossing before the final summit scramble. Elation! We had managed to summit something! After being sure we wouldn’t make it, the relief at not having to wake up the next morning to try again was palpable. We’d spent a good few hours above 5 000 metres and it was time to scramble back to camp quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supertramp morale was revolutionised! We felt that we could return to Orizaba and give it our best shot, safe in the knowledge that we had at least one summit shot with the MCSA Supertramp banner, should we not make it up. After a rest day eating fruit salad and unwittingly exploring the world’s largest pyramid (The Pyramid of Cholula), we returned to the base camp at Pico de Orizaba, ready for a New Year’s Eve summit the next day. Base camp was cold,windy and foggy, and chances of an easy climb seemed low, but as we turned in for our 7 pm bedtime, the skies cleared and the summit glacier beckoned promisingly to us. Suddenly we knew we would do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early morning, a quick breakfast of our secret oatmeal concoction and we were on the trail by 1:30 am. We set a brisk pace and took turns telling each other to slow down. But we felt good and our legs were enthusiastic to go. We passed afew other groups, and passed our previous high point quickly. We entered the so-called ‘labyrinth’ of ice and rock before the glacier proper, but the well-worn snow-pack was easy to follow in the dark. We had a quick break to drink and get out our axes, and then started the long crunch up the endless slope to the summit. The snow was perfect and firm: Chris set a good pace in front(breathing and wiggling his toes fiercely to keep them from frosting over) and the angle was just shallow enough to make the going bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an indeterminable time on the featureless slope, we zagged past a rocky outcrop, which we knew meant the summit was approaching. Feeling strong from our acclimatisation, we kicked into high gear and marched upwards. The slope steepened, then slackened, and we were there! We hit the snow-free crater-ridge(and what a crater!) just in time to welcome the first rays of daylight (and most welcome they were for our freezing toes). At 5 636 metres above sea level,the third highest point in North America, and the biggest volcano any of us had been on. After photos and a celebratory naartjie, we started loping back down the slope. Rick and Chris enjoyed sliding down the slowly softening snow, even practising some self-arrest, but the altitude had finally started to catch up with Michael.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no time, we were off the glacier, through the labyrinth, and walking barefoot back into base camp. Feeling strong, we were very pleased with our eight-hour tent-to-tent time. Climbing a mountain is an amazing feeling, but the comfort and relief of being out of danger and warming up a cup of hierbabuena tea(rooibos is a rare commodity in Mexico) is equally satisfying. Before long we were in the back of a Ford4x4 heading back into town, knowing that the hard partof our journey was behind us. What beckoned was travelling, bolted climbing routes, and enough tacos to make one sick (to make Chris sick, to be precise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/mex7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Izta&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017/mex8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Summit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supertramp story doesn’t end there: there were epic multi-pitch climbing routes in El Potrero Chico, some of Mexico’s finest tequila, many more buses,more pyramids, and amazing times shared between three good friends. But we had done what we came to do. Eventually the trio disbanded and continued indifferent directions. Super Rick went first, and after a three-hour detention on the Mexico-Texas border (no wall yet, he reports) he made it to California’sLake Tahoe, where he spent six glorious weeks skiing up and down the WestCoast’s finest powder. Super Chris left shortly thereafter, and after two days in Mexico City sorting out his passport and visa woes, he flew to Washington DC,where he is braving the winter months in a new job. And Super Mike… some say he is still to be found in a small pueblo in Mexico, climbing harder and harder routes, living off beans and the occasional tortilla, and slowly forgetting how to speak English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to say a very sincere thank you to The Mountain Club of South Africa and the anonymous donor, for honouring us with the Supertramp Award of 2016,that made this amazing trip possible. Also to our family and friends for putting up with our nonsense and supporting our adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

That is, I used various models and approaches to attempt to look holistically at Bolivia’s land, energy and water use, taking into account the expected impacts of climate change. One of the models I used is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onsset.org/&quot;&gt;OnSSET&lt;/a&gt; (EU-funding requires silly acronyms, apparently). This model (developed at KTH) is used to determine the best way to achieve universal electrification, by suggesting for each location in a country whether to extend the electrical grid, use a mini-grid system, or rather to rely on stand-alone household solar PV systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/onsset1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Onsset Bolivia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially the model takes in a variety of data on population distribution, energy infrastructure, solar intensity, night-time satellite imagery, as well as social and techno-economic factors. As a starting point, it uses this to estimate where the settlements are that already have electricity access. From there, the model spreads outwards from electrified locations, and for each new location, comparing the cost of connecting by the three different options. An exhaustive (-ing?) process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started overhauling this model while using it for my thesis, and as a result was talked into staying at the division as a Research Engineer. In essence, the model I inherited was a complicated mix of Excel macros, copy-pasting and difficult GIS instructions. During the course of my thesis I picked up Python and set to work replacing the model with a coherent Python library: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carderne/PyOnSSET&quot;&gt;PyOnSSET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made modelling a country a few orders of magnitude faster, and much easier to batch process huge jobs. So we immediately put it to work modelling the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa! The modelling unit is 1 km2  (more on that later) so this involved modelling more than 20 million individual units (iteratively!). We published this in Environmental Research Letters: &lt;a href=&quot;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7b29/meta&quot;&gt;Lighting the World: the first application of an open source, spatial electrification tool (OnSSET) on Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/onsset2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Onsset Africa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model was also used in the International Energy Agency’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://webstore.iea.org/weo-2017-special-report-energy-access-outlook&quot;&gt;Special Report: Energy Access Outlook&lt;/a&gt;  to show what is need to provide electricity to the millions in Africa currently without access (see the figure above, taken from the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I left KTH and the Division for Energy Systems Analysis before getting the time to fix two of the model’s biggest shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modelling 1 km2  grid cells, instead of representations of actual towns and villages. This means that a barren patch of land will get a solution, even if it’s never inhabited. This is not only inefficient, computationally, but     logically unsound. In the same way, larger towns and cities (anything more than 1 km2) can get split up into multiple modelling units, which doesn’t make a lot of sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It handles time in a very simplistic way, modelling only today  and 2030 (or another far-off year). This doesn’t exactly give policy-makers and private sector developers a good vision of where they should be going tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;

It’s a harsh and barren landscape, with the tail end of the Orange  River providing the only evidence that water ever reaches the area. The  80 km of super-corrugated mining roads at the end of our drive reminded  us repeatedly and shakily that we’d left the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, the very frantic park ranger told us that he didn’t  think there’d be any water in the entire area, so it might not be  possible to complete the hike. We decided to shorten our target to three  days, ditched any non-essentials, and loaded about twelve litres of  water into our bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a two hour land cruiser drive to the trail-head, along some  pretty serious 4×4 roads. Most of the way is completely barren, but as  we neared our destination a few grand quiver trees and low bushes  started to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quiver trees&quot; /&gt;
Golden quiver trees punctuate the sparse brush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We investigated the Zebrawater river(bed) on the first day, and  unsurprisingly, there was no water to be found. We were still treated to  a stunning view of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dernberg&quot;&gt;Dernberg&lt;/a&gt; , one of the most attractive peaks in the  park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zebrawater&quot; /&gt;
Matt and Zoom investigate the bone-dry Zebrawater, with the majestic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dernberg&quot;&gt;Dernberg&lt;/a&gt;  in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first short day of hiking ended in the Amphitheatre, and my  iPhone camera and mediocre photography skills fail to do justice to the  place. It’s the end point of the valley we hiked up, terminating on all  sides  (except the one we came in on) with sheer 100 metre high cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amphitheatre&quot; /&gt;
Inside the stunning Amphitheatre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom and I went for some scrambling up the least steep section, and  the perfect acoustics meant we could talk to Matt back at the bottom  without raising our voices, even from around 100 metres away. It got  dark pretty quickly inside there, so we got a fire going and enjoyed our  sparse few rusks and sips of whiskey. The complaints about discomfort  and cold from my less camping-n-hiking-smitten brothers were kept to an  impressive minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scrambling&quot; /&gt;
Zoom and I doing some scrambling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off bright and early the next morning, after I’d had a  bowl of oats, and Matt and Zoom had their Futurelife and Aeropress  coffee. Constantly counting the droplets of water we used, to make sure  our twelve litres would last (no spitting after you brush your teeth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heel hook&quot; /&gt;
When in doubt, heel hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then we found water! A murky little spring, too small and still  to be very inviting, but definite potential if we ran out of other  options. We dumped our bags there and set off for the Venstervalle (the  namesake of the hike), stopping for a group self timer on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brothers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Venstervalle is a beautiful arch, with a waterfall (dry now,  obviously) flowing out underneath it with about a 50 metre drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Venstervalle&quot; /&gt;
The Venstervalle, with Zoom in the bottom left and me on the right lying down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pushed on to God’s Window, but it wasn’t very impressive and it’s  an overused name anyway, so we returned to camp to enjoy the most  peaceful sunset possible. No people or running water for at least 50 km  in any direction, and barely an animal either. Really intense silence,  followed after by sunset by the starry Northern Cape heavens opening  above us. The night was colder than the one before, so some time after  midnight Matt knocked on the tent door and came to join Zoom and me on  the (not actually so) cosy inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we’d set a rendezvous time with the park rangers (back  at our original starting point, so we set of early to wind our way back  out of the valley. Stopping only to summit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dernberg&quot;&gt;Dernberg&lt;/a&gt;! Matt opted out of  the slightly hairy scramble to the top, so Zoom and I enjoyed our  panoramic view before rushing down to make the rendezvous on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dernberg&quot; /&gt;
The view from the top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dernberg&quot;&gt;Dernberg&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really fun brotherly trip, made more awesome by the sheer  remoteness and aloneness it offered. ‘n Veldie was nooit beter gewes  nie. By the time the land cruiser picked us up again, we were completely  out of food, water, rusks and whiskey, and very much looking forward to  the relative civilisation offered by Sendelingsdrif border post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I was lucky enough to join two UIAA youth meets. Youth rock climbing in Catalonia, organised by the FEEC, and the Kazbek mountaineering expedition, organised by the Mountaineering &amp;amp; Climbing Association of Georgia. They were both incredible experiences, with all the fun and excitement of long multi-pitch trad climbing, and then the fantastic highs and lows and dreary boredom one expects from a seven-day mountaineering expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;catalunya&quot;&gt;Catalunya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already headed to Spain this June to do some hiking in the Pyrenees with a good Spanish friend. As soon as I heard about the UIAA Global Youth Summit trip to Catalunya to do rock climbing on Montserrat and Pedraforca, it was clear my stars had aligned. I do a lot of rock climbing, but hadn’t yet had the gear or connections to do any multi-pitch trad climbing. The steep conglomerate of Montserrat and the cracked limestone of Pedraforca promised a great trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour was organised by the Federació d’Entitats Excursionistes de Catalunya (FEEC)and the group consisted of two great Catalunyan guides, five young guys from the Montserrat area, a Serbian climber, and me. We stayed in beautiful refugios at both climbing spots, and were treated to massive dinners of simple but delicious Spanish food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started in Montserrat, where the maze of needles and spires makes finding one’s way extremely difficult. We spent a day doing shorter slabby sport routes to get an idea of everyone’s abilities, and re-convened back at the refugio to pore over the guidebook and make plans for the next day. I joined for the more difficult route, six classic pitches up CADE (200m, 6a/Ae), a perfect crack between two spires. I seconded the whole way, and got to enjoy the fun route without much stress, especially enjoying the more difficult overhanging section near the top. Climbing with 150 metres of fresh air underneath my bum was a new experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/c1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hand jamming&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another day of climbing, we tumbled back into the kombi and drove to Pedraforca, now in the Pyrenean foothills. It’s a stunning mountain, which gets its name from its resemblance to a giant fork. We would be climbing only the north face, to keep out of the harsh Spanish summer sun. A group of us decided to climb the massive Gran Diedre route. Unfortunately, we were limited with time and people, so I had to climb second the whole way again. Nonetheless it was an incredible climb, rising for about ten pitches above the surrounding landscape. Most of the route follows a huge dihedral, and the climbing was easy and fun, up to grade V for a few pitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great experience and I can’t wait to get my hands on some more long trad routes. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to lead any of the long routes, so I still feel some big gaps in my experience. I was also hoping for a more varied and international group of climbers - I’m lucky enough to speak Spanish, but still would have enjoyed the chance to meet more like-minded climbers from further afield. Well done to FEEC, our awesome guides Pau and Faust, and the UIAA Youth Commission for making the trip happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kazbek&quot;&gt;Kazbek&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock climbing aside, Europe for the summer meant one thing was uppermost in my thoughts: alpinism. The UIAA had a number of youth expeditions planned, and I looked into all of them. Matterhorn - too daunting. Damavand - a bit pedestrian. Kazbek? Just right. I spoke to some more experienced friends and fellow MCSA members, and Kazbek seemed like just the place to have my next alpine experience. Steep and high and icy enough to be a challenge and a serious mountain, but straight-forward and well-trodden enough to offer some comfort to a relatively new mountaineer. My only experience before this was a guided ascent of the 6 088 metre Huayna Potosí in Bolivia, which had sealed my devotion to mountaineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew to Georgia’s capital and, after some much-needed sleep under a staircase,  met up with the team outside a shopping centre. Most were like me - keen to  climb a mountain, but either lacking experience or willing partners. Then seven  Koreans in matching shirts and hats came out of the supermarket with bundles of  food and confused smiles. The trip organiser, Zura Kutchava, bundled us all into  a rented minibus and soon we were pitching our tents near a beautiful old  monastery, with the majestic Kazbek dominating the skyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kazbek beckoning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The haphazard start - the Koreans had way too much gear, and didn’t seem in a  rush to make a plan - foreshadowed the dominant theme for the rest of the trip.  We trickled out of camp as and when we were ready, and made our way to the camp  at 3 000 metres, just across a torrential river of glacial melt-water. After  this, things sped up a bit, but we still spent a few hours every day waiting for  everyone to be ready. I never figured out what the delays were. This was my  first climb that could be described as an expedition, with horses carrying a  load to the first camp, and we later descended from 3 800 metres to pick up more  supplies from that camp. It was interesting (and exhausting) to see how this was  done. We camped at 2 000, 3 000, 3 800 (twice) and then at 4 200 metres before  the summit push to 5 047 metres. This was a lot more than most groups on the  mountain, but we wanted to maximise the chances for everyone to have a  successful summit. It also meant spending two nights on the frigid glacier at 4  200 metres, where I was unable to sleep in my otherwise trusty K-Way summer bag,  and not helped by the fact that my tent-mates were snoring happily in their  puffy expedition bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Meltwater&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unsympathetic pair were Javier and Izidor, from Spain and Slovenia. They  were both a lot more experienced than me, with experience above 7 000 metres,  and summits on many of the major ranges around the world. My tent-mates were  extremely helpful and I learnt so much from spending time with them (hours and  hours in the tent, avoiding the sun and then the cold) and being roped in with  them while crossing the frightening glacier, and for the summit. Eager and  excited, but with a well-honed respect for safety, they were good teachers and I  hope to do more mountaineering trips with them soon. The Koreans spoke limited  English so our interactions with them didn’t get far. The group of Georgians of  various experience levels provided great company every day and night, confirming  time and again the Georgian reputation for kindness and hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip was physically demanding, with heavy packs and many metres to climb, but we had an easy pace and it wasn’t a struggle. After crossing the low glacier (simple enough that there were horses crossing it) and checking in with border control at the ‘meteo station’, one can camp on the rugged moraine covering the glacier. From there it was a treacherous hike across the moraine, with crumbling rocks and deep crevasses, and one eye on the rock fall to the right, as helmet-sized boulders came speeding down and stopped just short of an unwelcome surprise. Then came the glacier proper – Gergeti, with cavernous crevasses and treacherous snow bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nearing the summit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that the snow covering got thicker where we made our high camp. We planned to leave at six the next morning, but six o’clock came and went, and most in the group were still inside their tents. This frustrated my one tent-mate past his breaking point, and after walking around agitating everyone to get going, he eventually gave up and set off by himself. This catalysed a bit of group movement and we set off not too far behind him. It was a sad moment, and reflected a brewing problem in the group dynamic. It’s a straightforward hike to the summit, with a relatively steep section at the end. We had a stunning view of the Caucasus from the shoulder, with Elbrus visible in the distance, but unfortunately the clouds came in as we did the last hundred metres, and we had a very white scene at the top. Still an awesome feeling to stand atop a mountain as imposing as Kazbek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On top!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked in teams of five and, apart from some tired-out Koreans stumbling on the descent, everything went smoothly. For me, the most tiring part of the entire trip was probably digging in and building walls for our tents on the glacier. My tent-mates decided they’d had enough and left the beginner to do the job. Luckily I was having fun and continued working on our fortification, because about an hour later a huge Georgian search-and-rescue helicopter landed a stone’s throw away and tried its best to send our camp tumbling along the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Roping up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helicopter revealed a very sad and real side to mountaineering. Two girls we’d befriended a few nights before at the lower camp, and who we’d seen coming down from the summit, had tried to descend the glacier without a rope. Although they were following the footsteps of a big roped team, a day of beating sun had made conditions precarious. One of the two made an unlucky step, and fell into a crevasse. She died quite soon after. This tragic event served as a sober reminder of the very real dangers in mountaineering. Their risky behaviour and the preventable nature of the accident only reinforced this lesson for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an amazing trip, and I learnt so much as a mountaineer and individual. My thanks go to Zura, the capable, lively and infinitely patient team leader, and the Mountaineering &amp;amp; Climbing Association of Georgia. Also to the UIAA for making the event possible, and the MCSA for making my participation possible.&lt;/p&gt;
