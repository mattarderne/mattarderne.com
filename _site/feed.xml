That is, I used various models and approaches to attempt to look holistically at Bolivia’s land, energy and water use, taking into account the expected impacts of climate change. One of the models I used is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onsset.org/&quot;&gt;OnSSET&lt;/a&gt; (EU-funding requires silly acronyms, apparently). This model (developed at KTH) is used to determine the best way to achieve universal electrification, by suggesting for each location in a country whether to extend the electrical grid, use a mini-grid system, or rather to rely on stand-alone household solar PV systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/onsset1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Onsset Bolivia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially the model takes in a variety of data on population distribution, energy infrastructure, solar intensity, night-time satellite imagery, as well as social and techno-economic factors. As a starting point, it uses this to estimate where the settlements are that already have electricity access. From there, the model spreads outwards from electrified locations, and for each new location, comparing the cost of connecting by the three different options. An exhaustive (-ing?) process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started overhauling this model while using it for my thesis, and as a result was talked into staying at the division as a Research Engineer. In essence, the model I inherited was a complicated mix of Excel macros, copy-pasting and difficult GIS instructions. During the course of my thesis I picked up Python and set to work replacing the model with a coherent Python library: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carderne/PyOnSSET&quot;&gt;PyOnSSET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made modelling a country a few orders of magnitude faster, and much easier to batch process huge jobs. So we immediately put it to work modelling the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa! The modelling unit is 1 km2  (more on that later) so this involved modelling more than 20 million individual units (iteratively!). We published this in Environmental Research Letters: &lt;a href=&quot;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7b29/meta&quot;&gt;Lighting the World: the first application of an open source, spatial electrification tool (OnSSET) on Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/onsset2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Onsset Africa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model was also used in the International Energy Agency’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://webstore.iea.org/weo-2017-special-report-energy-access-outlook&quot;&gt;Special Report: Energy Access Outlook&lt;/a&gt;  to show what is need to provide electricity to the millions in Africa currently without access (see the figure above, taken from the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I left KTH and the Division for Energy Systems Analysis before getting the time to fix two of the model’s biggest shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modelling 1 km2  grid cells, instead of representations of actual towns and villages. This means that a barren patch of land will get a solution, even if it’s never inhabited. This is not only inefficient, computationally, but     logically unsound. In the same way, larger towns and cities (anything more than 1 km2) can get split up into multiple modelling units, which doesn’t make a lot of sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It handles time in a very simplistic way, modelling only today  and 2030 (or another far-off year). This doesn’t exactly give policy-makers and private sector developers a good vision of where they should be going tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;

It’s a harsh and barren landscape, with the tail end of the Orange  River providing the only evidence that water ever reaches the area. The  80 km of super-corrugated mining roads at the end of our drive reminded  us repeatedly and shakily that we’d left the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, the very frantic park ranger told us that he didn’t  think there’d be any water in the entire area, so it might not be  possible to complete the hike. We decided to shorten our target to three  days, ditched any non-essentials, and loaded about twelve litres of  water into our bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a two hour land cruiser drive to the trail-head, along some  pretty serious 4×4 roads. Most of the way is completely barren, but as  we neared our destination a few grand quiver trees and low bushes  started to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quiver trees&quot; /&gt;
Golden quiver trees punctuate the sparse brush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We investigated the Zebrawater river(bed) on the first day, and  unsurprisingly, there was no water to be found. We were still treated to  a stunning view of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dernberg&quot;&gt;Dernberg&lt;/a&gt; , one of the most attractive peaks in the  park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zebrawater&quot; /&gt;
Matt and Zoom investigate the bone-dry Zebrawater, with the majestic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dernberg&quot;&gt;Dernberg&lt;/a&gt;  in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first short day of hiking ended in the Amphitheatre, and my  iPhone camera and mediocre photography skills fail to do justice to the  place. It’s the end point of the valley we hiked up, terminating on all  sides  (except the one we came in on) with sheer 100 metre high cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amphitheatre&quot; /&gt;
Inside the stunning Amphitheatre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom and I went for some scrambling up the least steep section, and  the perfect acoustics meant we could talk to Matt back at the bottom  without raising our voices, even from around 100 metres away. It got  dark pretty quickly inside there, so we got a fire going and enjoyed our  sparse few rusks and sips of whiskey. The complaints about discomfort  and cold from my less camping-n-hiking-smitten brothers were kept to an  impressive minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scrambling&quot; /&gt;
Zoom and I doing some scrambling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off bright and early the next morning, after I’d had a  bowl of oats, and Matt and Zoom had their Futurelife and Aeropress  coffee. Constantly counting the droplets of water we used, to make sure  our twelve litres would last (no spitting after you brush your teeth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heel hook&quot; /&gt;
When in doubt, heel hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then we found water! A murky little spring, too small and still  to be very inviting, but definite potential if we ran out of other  options. We dumped our bags there and set off for the Venstervalle (the  namesake of the hike), stopping for a group self timer on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brothers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Venstervalle is a beautiful arch, with a waterfall (dry now,  obviously) flowing out underneath it with about a 50 metre drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Venstervalle&quot; /&gt;
The Venstervalle, with Zoom in the bottom left and me on the right lying down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pushed on to God’s Window, but it wasn’t very impressive and it’s  an overused name anyway, so we returned to camp to enjoy the most  peaceful sunset possible. No people or running water for at least 50 km  in any direction, and barely an animal either. Really intense silence,  followed after by sunset by the starry Northern Cape heavens opening  above us. The night was colder than the one before, so some time after  midnight Matt knocked on the tent door and came to join Zoom and me on  the (not actually so) cosy inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we’d set a rendezvous time with the park rangers (back  at our original starting point, so we set of early to wind our way back  out of the valley. Stopping only to summit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dernberg&quot;&gt;Dernberg&lt;/a&gt;! Matt opted out of  the slightly hairy scramble to the top, so Zoom and I enjoyed our  panoramic view before rushing down to make the rendezvous on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016/r8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dernberg&quot; /&gt;
The view from the top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dernberg&quot;&gt;Dernberg&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really fun brotherly trip, made more awesome by the sheer  remoteness and aloneness it offered. ‘n Veldie was nooit beter gewes  nie. By the time the land cruiser picked us up again, we were completely  out of food, water, rusks and whiskey, and very much looking forward to  the relative civilisation offered by Sendelingsdrif border post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I was lucky enough to join two UIAA youth meets. Youth rock climbing in Catalonia, organised by the FEEC, and the Kazbek mountaineering expedition, organised by the Mountaineering &amp;amp; Climbing Association of Georgia. They were both incredible experiences, with all the fun and excitement of long multi-pitch trad climbing, and then the fantastic highs and lows and dreary boredom one expects from a seven-day mountaineering expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;catalunya&quot;&gt;Catalunya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already headed to Spain this June to do some hiking in the Pyrenees with a good Spanish friend. As soon as I heard about the UIAA Global Youth Summit trip to Catalunya to do rock climbing on Montserrat and Pedraforca, it was clear my stars had aligned. I do a lot of rock climbing, but hadn’t yet had the gear or connections to do any multi-pitch trad climbing. The steep conglomerate of Montserrat and the cracked limestone of Pedraforca promised a great trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour was organised by the Federació d’Entitats Excursionistes de Catalunya (FEEC)and the group consisted of two great Catalunyan guides, five young guys from the Montserrat area, a Serbian climber, and me. We stayed in beautiful refugios at both climbing spots, and were treated to massive dinners of simple but delicious Spanish food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started in Montserrat, where the maze of needles and spires makes finding one’s way extremely difficult. We spent a day doing shorter slabby sport routes to get an idea of everyone’s abilities, and re-convened back at the refugio to pore over the guidebook and make plans for the next day. I joined for the more difficult route, six classic pitches up CADE (200m, 6a/Ae), a perfect crack between two spires. I seconded the whole way, and got to enjoy the fun route without much stress, especially enjoying the more difficult overhanging section near the top. Climbing with 150 metres of fresh air underneath my bum was a new experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/c1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hand jamming&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another day of climbing, we tumbled back into the kombi and drove to Pedraforca, now in the Pyrenean foothills. It’s a stunning mountain, which gets its name from its resemblance to a giant fork. We would be climbing only the north face, to keep out of the harsh Spanish summer sun. A group of us decided to climb the massive Gran Diedre route. Unfortunately, we were limited with time and people, so I had to climb second the whole way again. Nonetheless it was an incredible climb, rising for about ten pitches above the surrounding landscape. Most of the route follows a huge dihedral, and the climbing was easy and fun, up to grade V for a few pitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great experience and I can’t wait to get my hands on some more long trad routes. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to lead any of the long routes, so I still feel some big gaps in my experience. I was also hoping for a more varied and international group of climbers - I’m lucky enough to speak Spanish, but still would have enjoyed the chance to meet more like-minded climbers from further afield. Well done to FEEC, our awesome guides Pau and Faust, and the UIAA Youth Commission for making the trip happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kazbek&quot;&gt;Kazbek&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock climbing aside, Europe for the summer meant one thing was uppermost in my thoughts: alpinism. The UIAA had a number of youth expeditions planned, and I looked into all of them. Matterhorn - too daunting. Damavand - a bit pedestrian. Kazbek? Just right. I spoke to some more experienced friends and fellow MCSA members, and Kazbek seemed like just the place to have my next alpine experience. Steep and high and icy enough to be a challenge and a serious mountain, but straight-forward and well-trodden enough to offer some comfort to a relatively new mountaineer. My only experience before this was a guided ascent of the 6 088 metre Huayna Potosí in Bolivia, which had sealed my devotion to mountaineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew to Georgia’s capital and, after some much-needed sleep under a staircase,  met up with the team outside a shopping centre. Most were like me - keen to  climb a mountain, but either lacking experience or willing partners. Then seven  Koreans in matching shirts and hats came out of the supermarket with bundles of  food and confused smiles. The trip organiser, Zura Kutchava, bundled us all into  a rented minibus and soon we were pitching our tents near a beautiful old  monastery, with the majestic Kazbek dominating the skyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kazbek beckoning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The haphazard start - the Koreans had way too much gear, and didn’t seem in a  rush to make a plan - foreshadowed the dominant theme for the rest of the trip.  We trickled out of camp as and when we were ready, and made our way to the camp  at 3 000 metres, just across a torrential river of glacial melt-water. After  this, things sped up a bit, but we still spent a few hours every day waiting for  everyone to be ready. I never figured out what the delays were. This was my  first climb that could be described as an expedition, with horses carrying a  load to the first camp, and we later descended from 3 800 metres to pick up more  supplies from that camp. It was interesting (and exhausting) to see how this was  done. We camped at 2 000, 3 000, 3 800 (twice) and then at 4 200 metres before  the summit push to 5 047 metres. This was a lot more than most groups on the  mountain, but we wanted to maximise the chances for everyone to have a  successful summit. It also meant spending two nights on the frigid glacier at 4  200 metres, where I was unable to sleep in my otherwise trusty K-Way summer bag,  and not helped by the fact that my tent-mates were snoring happily in their  puffy expedition bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Meltwater&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unsympathetic pair were Javier and Izidor, from Spain and Slovenia. They  were both a lot more experienced than me, with experience above 7 000 metres,  and summits on many of the major ranges around the world. My tent-mates were  extremely helpful and I learnt so much from spending time with them (hours and  hours in the tent, avoiding the sun and then the cold) and being roped in with  them while crossing the frightening glacier, and for the summit. Eager and  excited, but with a well-honed respect for safety, they were good teachers and I  hope to do more mountaineering trips with them soon. The Koreans spoke limited  English so our interactions with them didn’t get far. The group of Georgians of  various experience levels provided great company every day and night, confirming  time and again the Georgian reputation for kindness and hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip was physically demanding, with heavy packs and many metres to climb, but we had an easy pace and it wasn’t a struggle. After crossing the low glacier (simple enough that there were horses crossing it) and checking in with border control at the ‘meteo station’, one can camp on the rugged moraine covering the glacier. From there it was a treacherous hike across the moraine, with crumbling rocks and deep crevasses, and one eye on the rock fall to the right, as helmet-sized boulders came speeding down and stopped just short of an unwelcome surprise. Then came the glacier proper – Gergeti, with cavernous crevasses and treacherous snow bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nearing the summit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that the snow covering got thicker where we made our high camp. We planned to leave at six the next morning, but six o’clock came and went, and most in the group were still inside their tents. This frustrated my one tent-mate past his breaking point, and after walking around agitating everyone to get going, he eventually gave up and set off by himself. This catalysed a bit of group movement and we set off not too far behind him. It was a sad moment, and reflected a brewing problem in the group dynamic. It’s a straightforward hike to the summit, with a relatively steep section at the end. We had a stunning view of the Caucasus from the shoulder, with Elbrus visible in the distance, but unfortunately the clouds came in as we did the last hundred metres, and we had a very white scene at the top. Still an awesome feeling to stand atop a mountain as imposing as Kazbek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On top!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked in teams of five and, apart from some tired-out Koreans stumbling on the descent, everything went smoothly. For me, the most tiring part of the entire trip was probably digging in and building walls for our tents on the glacier. My tent-mates decided they’d had enough and left the beginner to do the job. Luckily I was having fun and continued working on our fortification, because about an hour later a huge Georgian search-and-rescue helicopter landed a stone’s throw away and tried its best to send our camp tumbling along the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2015/k4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Roping up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helicopter revealed a very sad and real side to mountaineering. Two girls we’d befriended a few nights before at the lower camp, and who we’d seen coming down from the summit, had tried to descend the glacier without a rope. Although they were following the footsteps of a big roped team, a day of beating sun had made conditions precarious. One of the two made an unlucky step, and fell into a crevasse. She died quite soon after. This tragic event served as a sober reminder of the very real dangers in mountaineering. Their risky behaviour and the preventable nature of the accident only reinforced this lesson for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an amazing trip, and I learnt so much as a mountaineer and individual. My thanks go to Zura, the capable, lively and infinitely patient team leader, and the Mountaineering &amp;amp; Climbing Association of Georgia. Also to the UIAA for making the event possible, and the MCSA for making my participation possible.&lt;/p&gt;
