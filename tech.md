I work as a Head of Data, specializing in Analytics and Aritificial Intelligence, and with a strong foundational basis in Data Warehousing & Data Integration. This means I am very comfortable across the data systems lifecycle with Python, ML, Neural Nets, SQL, ETL and general Data Wrangling. I'm also comfortable with Devops and managing AWS infra, BI tools such as Tableau and Looker and architecting these systems.
