I enjoy learning new things. This includes technology, physical skills and learning new sports. A few of the outdoor activities I enjoy include downhill skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, mountain-biking, rock-climbing & sailing. I also enjoy photography and videography.
I love reading and try to read a few books every month, usually a mix of fiction and non-fiction.

A few highlights of interest
# Skateboarding
I was lucky enough to join <a href="http://skategreenerpastures.com/matt-arderne/">a downhill skateboarding trip</a> in Switzerland at the height of my downhill skateboarding career. This is episode one.
