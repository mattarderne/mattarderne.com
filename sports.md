I enjoy learning new things. This includes technology, physical skills and learning new sports. A few of the outdoor activities I enjoy include downhill skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, mountain-biking, rock-climbing & sailing. I also enjoy photography and videography.
I love reading and try to read a few books every month, usually a mix of fiction and non-fiction.

A few highlights of interest

# Videography
I spent a few years learning about cameras, videography and filming action sports. The video below is probably the highlight outcome of that time, and something I still enjoy watching. The video was inspired by the song, and so I worked an idea into the flow of the song and took it from there.

# Skateboarding
I was lucky enough to join <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191102071210/skategreenerpastures.com/matt-arderne/">a downhill skateboarding trip</a> in Switzerland at the height of my downhill skateboarding career. This is episode one.
